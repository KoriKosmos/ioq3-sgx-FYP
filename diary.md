**Task**: Implemented random number generation within the SGX enclave.
- Replaced the previous string manipulation logic with a secure random number generator (`ecall_generate_random`).
- Utilized the `sgx_read_rand` function to generate a 32-bit random number securely within the enclave.
- Updated the untrusted application to call the new ECALL and display the random number.

**Problems Encountered**:
- Minor issues with header inclusions and function prototypes during the transition from the previous ECALL.
- Debugging required to ensure proper memory alignment and buffer handling.

**Solution**:
- Ensured the SGX headers were correctly included for random number generation.
- Verified the enclave functionality by running multiple tests to ensure consistent behavior.

**Next Steps**:
- Expand the enclave's functionality to include additional secure operations.
- Document the usage of `sgx_read_rand` and its constraints for future reference.

**Task**: Successfully implemented and tested a functional SGX project.
- Found a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c62hsZbX0) that demonstrated the correct setup for an SGX project.
- Simplified the enclave functionality by replacing the random number generation with a string manipulation ECALL.
- Updated paths to match the project's folder structure, ensuring the enclave file was correctly located.
- Verified the enclave's ability to modify a buffer passed from the untrusted application.

**Problems Encountered**:
- The SGX error code `0x2` (file not found) persisted until the absolute path to the enclave file was provided.
- Misunderstandings of EDL syntax and buffer handling initially caused incorrect behavior.

**Solution**:
- Used the tutorial as a guide to align project setup, build steps, and runtime configurations with best practices.
- Simplified the project to focus on a single working ECALL, reducing potential points of failure.

**Next Steps**:
- Expand functionality by adding more ECALLs and OCALLs for secure data processing.
- Document the lessons learned to streamline future SGX development.

## 2024-11-14
**Task**: Troubleshooted build and runtime errors in the TestEnclave project.
- Corrected the working directory configuration in the Visual Studio project settings.
- Addressed missing autogenerated header files by ensuring the `sgx_edger8r` tool was invoked properly during the build.
- Implemented debug output to log the current working directory and identify runtime issues.

**Problems Encountered**:
- Continued runtime failure when creating the enclave due to incorrect paths or missing dependencies.
- Limited feedback from SGX runtime error codes made debugging challenging.

**Next Steps**:
- Research SGX error codes and identify possible causes of enclave creation failure.
- Review official Intel SGX documentation and community forums for additional insights.

**Problems Encountered**:
- `TestEnclave_u.h` and other autogenerated files were not being created due to improper project configuration.
- Misconfigured working directory caused runtime errors when attempting to load the enclave.

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate and resolve missing autogenerated files by verifying `edger8r` tool execution.
- Fix runtime working directory issues to ensure the enclave file is located correctly.

## 2024-11-12
**Task**: Addressed foundational issues and established a functional framework for SGX development.
- Resolved enclave build errors by adding a minimal public root ECALL (`ecall_dummy`).

- Validated the build pipeline for both the enclave and the application.

**Problems Encountered**:
- Missing public root ECALL in the enclave, causing build failures.
- Dependency management for SGX-specific headers and libraries required careful configuration.

**Next Steps**:
- Expand the enclave functionality beyond placeholder ECALLs.
- Experiment with secure data processing and enclave-based computation.

## 2024-11-08
**Task**: Resolved DLL issues and switched to "Simulation" mode.
- Identified and imported the required DLLs from the SGX SDK and runtime libraries.
- Updated Visual Studio project settings to include the correct paths for the dependencies.
- Switched build mode from "Debug" to "Simulation" to address compatibility issues with the SGX plugin.

**Problems Encountered**:
- The missing DLLs were not documented clearly in the build instructions, requiring manual search and validation.

**Next Steps**:
- Rebuild the project in "Simulation" mode and test functionality.
- Verify that the "Simulation" build behaves as expected and explore SGX integration further.
